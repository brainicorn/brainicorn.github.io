      <description>Goblex (Go Buffering Lexer) Goblex is a library for easily building lexers in Go by utilizing an internal capture buffer so consumers can emit the tokens they care about and forget about the tokens they don&amp;rsquo;t.
This library was built out of necessity. It all began when we decided to write a build-time library that could generate json-schema from go structs&amp;hellip;
To accomplish this, we quickly realized we needed to build some sort of &amp;laquo;java-like&amp;raquo; annotation system (see our other post about that) which in-turn required us to use a lexer for finding complex annotations inside of go comments.</description>
